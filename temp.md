How compound nodes are related to sparsification

Combining or "compound" nodes in large graph visualizations can be related to the concept of graph sparsification. Graph sparsification is the process of approximating a dense graph with a sparser graph that preserves certain properties of the original graph.

One way to sparsify a graph is by merging together similar or closely-related nodes into a single "compound" node. This can help to reduce the number of nodes in the graph while still preserving important structural properties, such as the presence of communities or clusters within the graph. This is done by creating meta-nodes of multiple similar nodes, this is similar to how "compound" or "combos" nodes work in large graph visualizations.

Additionally, combining similar nodes into a single node can also reduce the number of edges in the graph, making it easier to visualize and analyze. This is because the edges between the nodes that are combined into a single node are removed, resulting in a sparser graph with fewer edges.

In summary, combining similar nodes into "compound" or "combos" nodes in large graph visualizations can be related to the concept of graph sparsification, in that it helps to reduce the number of nodes and edges in the graph, while preserving important structural properties of the graph. This can make the graph easier to visualize and analyze, making it more informative for the user.


Evaluation metrics:

- Graph shape

- Whether certain properties are preserved
    – For single value properties (E.g. clustering coefficient,
    average path length), one can measure whether this
    value is preserved
    – For distributional properties (E.g. degree distribution,
    component size distribution), one can compute the
    distance between two distributions (e.g. KL divergence)

- Whether certain end‐task can be performed
    similarly
    – Performing a certain task using the sampled network,
    and check whether the results are similar to those when
    the full network is used




Some techniques that are used to optimize the visualization of big graphs include:

Graph sparsification: This technique involves removing unnecessary or redundant edges from the graph to reduce complexity and improve performance.

Graph summarization: This technique involves creating a summary or simplified version of the graph that preserves important features or patterns.

Graph clustering: This technique involves grouping nodes or edges together based on similarity or relationship, which can help reduce complexity and improve readability.

Graph partitioning: This technique involves dividing the graph into smaller, more manageable pieces that can be visualized independently.

Graph compression: This technique involves reducing the size of the graph data by using techniques such as lossy compression or data encoding.

Graph visualization algorithms: There are many algorithms and techniques that have been developed specifically for visualizing large graphs, such as force-directed layouts, multidimensional scaling, and hierarchical layouts.

Graph visualization tools: There are many specialized tools and software packages that can be used to visualize large graphs, such as Gephi, Graphviz, and Cytoscape. These tools often provide a range of features and customization options to help optimize the visualization of big graphs.

Graph reduction: This technique removes less important nodes and edges from the graph, resulting in a simplified version of the original graph.

Graph abstraction: This technique creates a higher-level representation of the graph, where nodes and edges are grouped into larger clusters. This can make it easier to understand the overall structure of the graph.

Graph pruning: This technique removes nodes and edges that are not directly connected to the most important nodes in the graph.

Edge bundling: As mentioned previously, this technique groups together related edges, reducing clutter and making the graph easier to interpret.

Aggregation: This technique combines similar nodes into a single node, reducing clutter and making the graph easier to read.

By using these techniques, you can create a simplified version of the original graph that is easier to understand and interpret.
